                This anti-harassment policy is based on <a className={`conduct-paragraph-anchor`} href="/">the example policy</a> from 
                the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers. 
                <br/><br/>
                This policy is based on several other policies, including the Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, 
                written by Esther Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. 
                Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the policies 
                and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this work.

            In addition to governing our own events by this policy, Open Sacramento will only lend its brand and fund groups 
            that offer an anti-harassment policy to their attendees. For information on how to offer an anti-harassment policy 
            to your group, <a className={`conduct-paragraph-anchor`} href="/">see this guide.</a>

            gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.

            Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity 
            and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images 
            in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; 
            sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; 
            unwarranted exclusion; and patronizing language or action.
          </p>

          <p className={`conduct-item-paragraph`}>
            If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, 
            including warning the offender or expulsion from Open Sacramento network activities, events, and digital forums.
          </p>

          <p className={`conduct-item-paragraph`}>
            If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, 
            please contact a member of the event staff or forum administrator immediately. You can contact them at leaders [at] 
            opensacramento [dot] org or (916) 835-9607. Event staff or forum administrators will be happy to help participants 
            contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment 
            to feel safe for the duration of the event.

            You can also contact Open Sacramento about harassment at hello@codeforsacramento.org and feel free to use the 
            email template below. Open Sacramento staff acknowledge that we are not always in a position to evaluate a given situation 
            due to the number of events and the fact that our team is not always present. However, we are hopeful that by providing 
            these guidelines we are establishing a community that jointly adheres to these values and can provide an environment 
            that is welcoming to all.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className={`conduct-sub-heading`}>
            We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy 
            a harassment-free environment.
