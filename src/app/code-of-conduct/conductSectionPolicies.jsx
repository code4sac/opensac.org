          This anti-harassment policy is based on <a className={`conduct-paragraph-anchor`} href="/">the example
          policy</a> from
          the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.
          <br/><br/>
          This policy is based on several other policies, including the Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment policy,
          written by Esther Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project.
          Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the policies
          and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this
          work.

          including warning the offender or expulsion from Open Sacramento network activities, events, and digital
          forums.
        </p>

          You can also contact Open Sacramento about harassment at hello@codeforsacramento.org and feel free to use the
          email template below. Open Sacramento staff acknowledge that we are not always in a position to evaluate a
          given situation
          due to the number of events and the fact that our team is not always present. However, we are hopeful that by
          providing
          these guidelines we are establishing a community that jointly adheres to these values and can provide an
          environment
          that is welcoming to all.
        </p>

        <h3 className={`conduct-sub-heading`}>
          We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy
          a harassment-free environment.
